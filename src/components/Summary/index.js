I have been involved in development since I was 12 years old, when a teacher invited me to participate in a selection for the school's robotics team, and I started to learn C. I was very happy when I managed to answer my first question: <a href="https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/pratique/pj/2014/f1/fliper/">Flíper (OBI 2014)</a>. From then on I became very interested in the area, I participated in some marathons, I ended up doing a Technician course in Informatics at the IFPB integrated into high school. And today I am graduating in Computer Science at UFCG. The area I like the most, today, is the Web.</span>
